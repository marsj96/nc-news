## seed

- Unique constraint not strictly necessary as PRIMARY KEY states it must be unique.
- missing a few `NOT NULL` constraints you might find helpful for error handling
- consider extracting out table creations/drops/insertions into their own functions to tidy things up
- nice and tidy otherwise!


## routes
- nice use of `.route` - don't forget that this allows you to chain on http methods though!
- nice and tidy. Some possible invalid method error handling if you have time?



## controllers
- consider separating you controllers into separate files! if you had 100s of functions you're going to have a bad time navigating this project.
- use this shorthand for creating objects `{topics: topics} === {topics}`
- patch request is sending back the status code ðŸ‘€
- `sendComment` - I'd like the the freshly post comment id with my response body plz.
- don't see any error handling for `deleteComment` ðŸ¥º
- for the `/api` endpoint you don't need to read the file, just require in the JSON. No need for a model ðŸ™Œ
- in general nice and tidy functions!
- nice destructuring.




## models
- really love the comments!
- nice error handling in `fetchArticleById` consider switching to `.test` though which will give you a boolean instead of an array or null. You're relying on the truthy falsy nature of those values.
- `fetchArticleById` - why are you querying the DB twice to get the comment count? Two connections from the pool are being used up slowing down the server for other users. SQL is designed to be incredibly performant with complex queries such as this. Make use of `JOIN` to get everything you need in one query. Also `commentCountPromise` is over fetching data for the DB. You're asking for EVERYTHING just to count the number of rows. Seems like a waste.
- _checks that the passed body only has 1 property_ error handling you probably don't want! This endpoint is `PATCH /api/article/:article_id`
so you won't necessarily only get one key on the body.
- _checks that the passed id is a digit_ I would let SQL throw this error. Any changes the DB in the future would automatically be handled by the constraints we added to the columns.
- no need for multiple queries in `changeArticleById`. No need to `SELECT` first!
- some error handling missing in your models ðŸ‘€
- order has default value of `desc`, no?
- `fetchArticles` could be dried up a bit I reckon
- nested `.then` blocks! ðŸš¨



## errors
- `const { restart } = require("nodemon")` ??
- think about invalid method error
- don't forget to remove `console.log` once you're done with it!

## misc
- write your own readme
- remove unnecessary `.md` files
- nice and tidy project though!



## Test Output

Read through all errors. Note that any failing test could be caused by a problem uncovered in a previous test on the same endpoint.

### ESSENTIAL GET `/api/articles?sort_by=author`

Assertion: expected 'butter_bridge' to equal 'rogersop'

## Extra Advanced Tasks

### Easier

- [ ] Patch: Edit an article body
- [ ] Patch: Edit a comment body
- [ ] Patch: Edit a user's information
- [ ] Get: Search for an article by title
- [ ] Post: add a new user

### Harder

- [ ] Protect your endpoints with JWT authorization. We have notes on this that will help a bit, _but it will make building the front end of your site a little bit more difficult_
- [ ] Get: Add functionality to get articles created in last 10 minutes
- [ ] Get: Get all articles that have been liked by a user. This will require an additional junction table.
- [ ] Research and implement online image storage or random generation of images for topics
